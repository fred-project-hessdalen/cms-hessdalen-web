📋 Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Keep Current System (DONE ✅)
Your token-based profile editor stays exactly as-is:

/profile/[token] - Public route, no login needed
Works forever, never breaks
Perfect for one-off updates
Phase 2: Add Authentication (Recommended: NextAuth.js)
Why NextAuth.js?
✅ Well-integrated with Next.js 15
✅ Supports multiple auth providers
✅ Built-in session management
✅ Easy to add OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
✅ Can use magic links (email-based, no password)
Architecture:

// New routes structure:
/profile/[token]           // Token-based (keep as-is)
/auth/signin               // Login page
/auth/signup               // Registration (optional)
/member/dashboard          // Protected route (requires login)
/member/profile            // Logged-in profile editor
/member/events             // Member-only content

🔐 Best Authentication Strategy for Your Use Case
Option A: Magic Link Authentication (Recommended)
Best for: Academic/research community, low friction

// Example with NextAuth.js
providers: [
  EmailProvider({
    server: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER,
    from: 'noreply@hessdalen.com'
  })
]

Pros:

✅ No passwords to remember
✅ Email-based (similar to token links)
✅ Very secure
✅ Familiar flow for users
✅ Easy upgrade path from tokens
Cons:

⚠️ Requires email server setup
⚠️ Slightly slower than password login
Option B: Email + Password
Best for: Traditional login expectations

providers: [
  CredentialsProvider({
    name: 'Email',
    credentials: {
      email: { label: "Email", type: "email" },
      password: { label: "Password", type: "password" }
    },
    async authorize(credentials) {
      // Verify against Sanity or separate user DB
    }
  })
]

Pros:

✅ Instant login (no email wait)
✅ Familiar to users
✅ Works offline
Cons:

⚠️ Password management complexity
⚠️ Need password reset flow
⚠️ Security considerations
Option C: OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
Best for: International community, convenience

providers: [
  GoogleProvider({
    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  }),
  GitHubProvider({
    clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
  })
]

Pros:

✅ Zero password management
✅ Very secure
✅ One-click login
✅ Users already have accounts
Cons:

⚠️ Requires OAuth app setup
⚠️ Some users prefer not to use Google/GitHub
🎨 How Token & Login Coexist
Scenario 1: New Member (Token First)
1. Admin sends token link: /profile/abc-123
2. Member updates profile (no login needed)
3. Member sees: "Create account for more features"
4. Member clicks, enters email
5. Account created, linked to their person record
6. Now has access to member dashboard

Scenario 2: Existing Member (Login)
1. Member goes to /auth/signin
2. Logs in with email/magic link
3. Sees dashboard with profile editor
4. Can also use token link (same data)

Scenario 3: Lost Access (Token Fallback)
1. Member forgets password / loses login
2. Admin re-sends token link
3. Member updates profile immediately
4. Can reset password later if needed

💻 Code Structure Example
Link Person Record to Auth User
// /studio/schemaTypes/personType.ts
{
  name: 'authUserId',
  title: 'Auth User ID',
  type: 'string',
  description: 'Linked authentication user ID (optional)',
  hidden: true,
  readOnly: true,
}

Unified Profile Editing
// /web/src/app/member/profile/page.tsx
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { ProfileEditForm } from '@/components/ProfileEditForm'

export default async function MemberProfilePage() {
  const session = await getServerSession()
  
  // Fetch person data by linked authUserId
  const person = await fetchPersonByAuthId(session.user.id)
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your Profile</h1>
      <ProfileEditForm person={person} mode="authenticated" />
    </div>
  )
}

Token Route (Unchanged)
// /web/src/app/profile/[token]/page.tsx
// Stays exactly as-is!
// No changes needed

🚀 Recommended Implementation Order
Step 1: Add NextAuth.js (2-4 hours)
npm install next-auth @auth/core

Create basic email authentication:

Magic link login
Session management
Protected routes
Step 2: Add authUserId Link (30 minutes)
Add field to person schema
Create function to link person to auth user
Can be done manually first, automated later
Step 3: Create Member Dashboard (2-4 hours)
/member/dashboard - Landing page
/member/profile - Profile editor (reuse component)
/member/events - Example protected content
Step 4: Add CTA to Token Page (30 minutes)
Add banner: "Want to save your login? Create an account!"
Link to signup with pre-filled email
Step 5: Additional Features (ongoing)
RSVP system
File downloads
Private research notes
Whatever you need!
📊 Comparison Table
Feature	Token-Based	Login-Based	Best For
Setup effort	✅ Done	⚠️ 1-2 days	Quick start
User friction	✅ Zero	⚠️ Medium	One-time edits
Security	✅ Good	✅ Better	Both work
Feature access	⚠️ Limited	✅ Unlimited	Complex features
Scalability	✅ Good	✅ Excellent	Long-term
Email dependence	✅ Admin sends	✅ User controls	Both work
✅ My Recommendation
Keep both! Here's why:

Token links = Onboarding ramp

Gets people updating their info immediately
No barrier to entry
Admin maintains control
Login = Power user upgrade

Opt-in for engaged members
Unlocks advanced features
Better UX for repeat visits
Progressive enhancement

Start simple (tokens)
Upgrade when needed (login)
Both coexist peacefully
